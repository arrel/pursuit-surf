I really think it'd be amazing if kids could just build stuff, you know, big stuff. Maybe treehouses or skate ramps? Something that gets them outside and actually using tools. Could be cool?

RESTAURANT
I've always thought we should try to create our own restaurant, but like, not a regular restaurant, something totally different, something totally unique. Like the kids would plan menus, learn cooking, but also manage money, budgeting, you know? And then they could invite parents or families, or even other kids from different schools. It would teach so many things—cooking, budgeting, teamwork, but also design, like designing menus, signs, maybe even uniforms. They'd have to problem-solve, like how much food to buy, what to charge, how to deal with allergies. And it wouldn't be just food, they'd also decorate it, decide the theme, maybe it could change every week? It might get chaotic, but they'd learn from chaos. Basically, they'd be entrepreneurs. Kids don't usually get to do that, but they totally should, because they'd love it, and they'd learn cooking and budgeting and teamwork. Like really real-world, right? They'd invite people, serve food, take feedback, and learn from it. It would be chaotic, sure, but good chaos.

VIDEOGAME

So, I think kids love video games, and we should use that. Could they make a game? Wait—maybe not make it completely from scratch, that's hard, maybe mod an existing game? Or no, maybe they could actually make one. But small, like a simple platformer. Or an RPG, because storytelling is important. They'd learn coding, right? Or storytelling. Actually, storytelling is more important because it's everywhere. Maybe just do storytelling through video games? Like narrative-driven games. But coding too, because coding is practical and parents love practical stuff. Can we do both? Coding a narrative-driven game. Maybe a historical game, kids love history. They'd research, write stories, then code them? Maybe that's too much though. Could we just prototype it or sketch it out first? Anyway, definitely something with games, coding, and storytelling.

SHARKTANK
Okay, so I keep thinking about how kids need to learn about money, business, negotiating—like actual real-world stuff, right? What if we had them create businesses, like real ones, not just theoretical? But also, like, they could make products or services that the school or parents would actually pay for? Or maybe we bring in people from local businesses who could be “investors,” but instead of just pretend money, they could offer real mentorship or job shadows? And maybe there's a philanthropy component too, like, they have to pitch a business that solves a problem in their community? But I also kind of want them to build physical prototypes, because hands-on is always better. But what about AI? Like, what if they had to integrate AI into their business model somehow? Is that too much? Maybe that's another pursuit. Or maybe it's just the final challenge. Anyway, something along these lines.

THEMEPARK
I've been thinking about engineering and storytelling together. Like, kids design and build something immersive. Could be a theme park (scaled down obviously), like different “lands” that represent different subjects they've learned. Or maybe an interactive museum that people actually visit? But I also love the idea of them designing an escape room because it's puzzles, problem-solving, storytelling, and physical construction all at once. They'd have to study real escape room design, work in teams to create puzzles, build the props, and test them with real users. Could be totally student-run. But would it be too much for five weeks? What if they can't finish? Maybe we start with just one escape room and iterate each time. Need to think through logistics, materials, and how we'd test it before the end. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

MINICITY
Alright, hear me out—what if we just let students build an entire city from scratch? Like, we give them a big open space and they have to create everything—a government, economy, infrastructure, transportation, energy, all of it. Maybe they start by researching different types of governments and how cities function, then decide what kind of society they want to create. Would they go full democracy? Dictatorship? Some weird new hybrid government? And then they have to design laws and policies and see if it actually works in practice,
And I love the idea of them having actual currency—maybe we give them a set amount of play money at the start and they have to figure out jobs and wages and taxes. Would they create businesses? A banking system? What happens if someone commits a “crime”? Would they have police or is it all community-run? Maybe they even have to elect a leader and see if power goes to their head—I bet it would.

Also, how do they physically build the city? Is it all digital, like in Minecraft or SimCity? Or do they actually construct miniature buildings and roads? Could they use recycled materials? What if we tied it to sustainability, so they have to figure out how to make it environmentally friendly? Could they generate their own electricity somehow? Maybe someone's in charge of food production—does the city have farms? Do they import goods? What happens if they run out of resources—do they go to war with another group?? That would be kind of fascinating to watch.

I think the challenge here is time. Five weeks is not a long time to build an entire functioning civilization. But maybe we focus on just one aspect—like government and economics, or just the physical city planning. Or maybe we give each student a role, and it all comes together like a giant social experiment. I don't know, this could either be incredible or a total disaster, but I feel like they'd never forget it.

CRISIS
Okay, so I've been thinking about how schools always teach “problem-solving,” but they never actually let kids tackle real problems, like ones that actual professionals are trying to figure out right now. What if we picked a real-world issue and just turned them loose on it? Like, they get five weeks to actually come up with a legitimate solution to something big—homelessness, food waste, affordable housing, access to clean water—something that doesn't just have a neat little answer in a textbook but is actually unsolved in the real world,

I love the idea of them working in teams, but also connecting with actual experts, like calling up city officials, scientists, or business leaders to get real data and feedback. And then they have to actually do something—maybe they prototype a solution, maybe they run a campaign, maybe they build an app that helps people find resources. What if we told them at the start, “By the end of this pursuit, you must have taken a real action that has a measurable impact on this issue”? Would they rise to the challenge, or would they just Google stuff and write reports like school normally makes them do? I don't want reports—I want impact.

The hard part is, how do we pick an issue? Do we let them vote on one, or do they each pick their own? And how do we make sure they don't just get overwhelmed by how big these problems are? Like, if they pick climate change, are they going to feel like their five-week project is pointless? Maybe we focus on local problems—like, “Fix something broken in our community.” But then, is that still ambitious enough? What if they actually pitched their ideas to a panel of real experts at the end, like a big Shark Tank-style event where the best ideas get funding or help from real organizations?

I think this could be one of the most meaningful pursuits we've ever done if we structure it right, but I also worry about it feeling too big or too vague. We'd have to scaffold it a lot to keep them from just spinning their wheels for five weeks. But man, imagine if they actually solved something. Like, actually changed something in the real world. That would be insane.
